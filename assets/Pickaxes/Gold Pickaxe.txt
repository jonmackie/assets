Gold Pickaxe: This one is bright and shiny. The head should be a vibrant yellow, 
resembling polished gold, with a few lighter yellow pixels to give it a gleaming effect. 
The handle can be a rich, dark brown, providing a nice contrast to the bright gold. 
The gold parts might have a few tiny sparkles to emphasize its precious material.
