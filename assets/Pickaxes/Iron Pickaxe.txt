Iron Pickaxe: This pickaxe should have a classic, sturdy appearance.
The head is a dark, metallic gray, with a slightly lighter gray
along the edges to suggest a sharp, well-forged blade. The handle
is a brown wooden color, with a few darker pixels to indicate wood
grain. Overall, it should have a simple, utilitarian look.
