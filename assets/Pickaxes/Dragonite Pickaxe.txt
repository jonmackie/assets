Dragonite Pickaxe: For the dragonite pickaxe, use a rich, dark red for the head, 
with lighter red or orange pixels to mimic the appearance of smoldering embers. 
The head could have a slightly jagged or flame-like design to emphasize its dragon-inspired theme. 
The handle might be black or dark brown, with a rugged texture.
