Obsidian Shadow axe: This axe should have a sleek, dark design. 
Use black for the head, with shades of dark gray for a subtle, glass-like texture. 
The edges of the axe head could have a few pixels of very dark purple or blue to
suggest a mystical aura. The handle should be a matte black, with minimal detailing for a modern, 
minimalist look.
